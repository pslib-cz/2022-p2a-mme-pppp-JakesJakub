# Swinging Doors for Micro:Bit cars
![Assembled](https://github.com/pslib-cz/2022-p2a-mme-pppp-JakesJakub/assets/91247920/fc922db6-7eba-4ff1-8247-1ff9e4af290b)
  These 3D printed swinging doors are made for being used as a obstacle for Micro:Bit cars. Cars will have to open the door, placed on the side of the racing track, by pushing into them from either side and continue driving. Once opened, the door will close by itself.

## Materials used and cost:
### Materials:
- PLA filament
- rubber band

### Cost:
- Roughly 75,- Kƒç/3,40 $/3,17 EUR

## How to print and setup:

### How to print:
1. Download the [3D print files](FilesFor3DPrit)
2. In the printing software, set the following parameters:
- desired size (recommended: 125%)
- set printing speed on 100mm/s
- set fill on at least 10%
The printing time is going to take roughly 9 hours. (depending on set parameters, the time may vary)

###How to setup:

After printing is done, you are left with 3 printed pieces, that you will put together
1. Take Part2 (door) and insert into Part1 (stand).
2. Take Part3 (weight) and insert into Part1 (stand).
3. Take rubber band and attach Part1 to Part2 by hooks placed on the top of both parts.
4. If the Swinging Doors don't stay in place when used, take extra weight and place on top of Part3.
