# Swinging Doors for Micro:Bit self-driving cars
![Assembled](https://github.com/pslib-cz/2022-p2a-mme-pppp-JakesJakub/assets/91247920/fc922db6-7eba-4ff1-8247-1ff9e4af290b)
  <p>These 3D printed swinging doors are made for being used as a obstacle for Micro:Bit cars. Cars will have to open the door, placed on the side of the racing track, by pushing into them from either side and continue driving. Once opened, the door will close by itself.</p>

<h2>How to print and setup:</h2>
<p>1. Download the 3D print files</p>
<p>2. In the printing software, set the following parameters:</p>
<li>desired size (recommended: 125%)</li>
<li>printing speed</li>
<p>The printing time is going to take roughly 3 hours. (depending on set parameters, the time may vary)</p>
